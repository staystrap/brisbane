title: Places to stay
---

Finding a place to stay in the beginning is probably the hardest part.
Luckily, the competition for a place is not as fierce as in some larger cities.
You basically have three options: staying with a guest family (homestay), sharing
a house with people (sharehouse/shareflat) or sharing a room with somebody.
Be very aware that **rent is calculated off a weekly rate!**.
To suit your taste, the best tactic is probably:

1. Stay in a hostel for the first days
2. Visit the most appealing offers from the following sites:
  -  [Brisbane Homestay](https://www.brisbanehomestay.org/)
  -  [Homestayfinder](http://www.homestayfinder.com/)
  -  [flatmates](http://flatmates.com.au)
  -  [gumtree](http://gumtree.com.au)
3. Upon signing, make sure you receive an RTA form for the bond.
   This will ensure, that you will receive it back.

Gumtree is a site that you can use to buy and sell used stuff. Most of the trades
of this type take place here.

On homestays: Homestays are an easy way to have bed under a dry roof in Australia.
Everything depends on the type of hostfamily you are with. Some force you to be there
for dinner at 7 p.m., while others don't.

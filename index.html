A nice place for a temporary stay. Life is as costly as
sunny in this giant village. Amid thousands of Queenslanders,
the few skyscrapers in Brisbanes central business district (CBD)
stand out strongly. Most of Brisbanes young life takes place around this area.
Prepare for an active time in every regard:
International studentlife is happening 24/7, there is always time for sports
and weekends are mostly spent outside of Brisbane, travelling.

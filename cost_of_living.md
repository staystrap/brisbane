Overall, nearly eveything can be considered expensive by European standards in Australia.
Luckily, salaries are adapted, and even interns can live off their wage.

Have a look at what you can roughly expect to pay here:

| Position | Price |
|----------+-------|
| Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner | A$10+ |
| Groceries for the week | A$ 70-100 |
| A jug of cheap beer | A$8-10 |
| Rent (per week) | A$220 |
| Bond | Usually 4x rent |
| Cellular service (including Internet) | A$25 |

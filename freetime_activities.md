An awesome group to meet people is the University of Queenslands student-run
exchange group, [QUEST](http://www.questsociety.net/). They organise trips,
parties, meet-ups, and are open towards everyone. Perfect if you are new to 
the city and don't have anyone to invite you to the cool parties.

# Sport
It feels as if everyone in Queensland works out on a regular basis, so you will
not have problems to find sport partners. Strewn along Brisbane river
you can find basic workout equipment such as pullup bars.

Fitness clubs can be found nearly everywhere - membership is between AUD 15 and 30.

UQSport's offerings in St Lucia can be fully recommended. The sport facilities are superb,
and everything from Tennis to Canoe Polo is available. They also offer a [Gold membership](https://www.uqsport.com.au/memberships)
which is worth the money if you want to workout daily.
